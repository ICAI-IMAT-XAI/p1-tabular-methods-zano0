class ShapleyExplainer:

    This class provides a simple implementation of Shapley values for model

    feature subsets.

            The predictive model to be explained. Must accept a NumPy array

        background_dataset (np.ndarray):
            Background dataset used for estimating feature contributions.
            Typically a representative sample of the input data.
